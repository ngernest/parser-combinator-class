# Parser Combinator Class (CIS 1940, Spring 2023)

This repository contains teaching materials on parser combinators 
that I developed for [CIS 1940 (Introduction to Haskell)](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring23/) at the University of Pennsylvania, 
during the Spring 2023 semester when I served as a teaching assistant. 

This repo is organised as follows:
- The [class](./class/) subfolder contains in-class Haskell exercises.
- The [homework](./homework/) folder contains a programming assignment that I created, 
where students implement a Haskell parser for S-expressions and test their parser 
using QuickCheck round-trip properties.
- The lecture slides I made can be found at [parsing_slides.pdf](./parsing_slides.pdf).

When creating these teaching materials, I referenced Professor Stephanie Weirich's lecture notes 
for [CIS 5520 (Advanced Programming)](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis5520/current/lectures/stub/10-parsers/Parsers.html), as well as Brent Yorgey's lectures for [CIS 1940 in Spring 2013](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/).
